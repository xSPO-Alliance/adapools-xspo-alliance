# Registration

In this repo stake pool operators can register to become a member of the xSPO Alliance. After you have become an official member your pool will be visible on https://adapools.org/alli and also on https://adafolio.com/community-portfolios
Please like the latter so we stay on top of the list!

#Disclaimer
By submitting a pull request you agree that all the submited information will be made publicly available to everyone.
Also, by submitting you agree that you fit the critera of an xSPO.  Our rules are very simple, just have less than â‚³1M in total active stake as you join, and be an active member of our community on discord.

# REQUIREMENTS:
- Github Account
- Pool_id
- Less than 1m Stake
- Single Pool Operator

# STEP 1 (Create an Issue from template):
Go to github.com and login with your account.

Navigate to the xSPO registration Issue Tab and click on 'Get Started'.  
https://github.com/xSPO-Alliance/adapools-xspo-alliance/issues/new/choose

# STEP 2 (Add your pool info):
Add a Title (optional)  
Add your pool id (bech32_id)  
Then 'Submit new issue'  

# STEP 3 (Wait the issue to be closed automacally):
Check your issue labels  
 - pool_added (success!)
 - pool_not_added (failure!)

If everything is done correctly you should see that all Checks have passed. And the pool is added to the end of this file [xspo-alliance-members.json](./xspo-alliance-members.json)  
If it fails (possible problems):  
 - Pool id is wrong  
 - Pool is already added to the xSPO-Alliance  
 - Pool is showing as not registered yet on mainnet  
 - Verification API is out of service (this case try re-open the same issue in a few minutes)  
 - Pool has more than 1M active stake (not meet minimal requirements)

Just drop a message in discord and we will fix it together.
